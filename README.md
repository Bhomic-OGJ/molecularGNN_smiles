# GNN_molecules

This is a code for molecular property prediction (MPP) using a graph neural network (GNN) based on r-radius subgraph (or called fingerprint) embeddings. This GNN is proposed in our paper "[Compound-protein Interaction Prediction with End-to-end Learning of Neural Networks for Graphs and Sequences (Bioinformatics, 2018)](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty535/5050020?redirectedFrom=PDF)," which aims to predict compound-protein interactions. In this implementation, we provide our GNN to predict various molecular properties such as drug efficacy and photovoltaic efficiency.
